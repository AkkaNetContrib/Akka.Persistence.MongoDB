This PR fixes a number of problems stemming from implementations of Akka.Persistence.Query implementations that were incorrect.

**Note: we're working on [adding support for future versions of Akka.Persistence.MongoDB and you should read them here if you plan on continuing to use the plugin](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.Persistence.MongoDB/issues/72).**
